LocalStack&amp;rsquo;s logging setup allows you to:
Discover errors in your code during development &amp;amp; testing. Get visibility into how and why your API calls are failing. Figure out unexpected errors such as Lambda timeouts and more! With LocalStack logging, you can easily retrieve additional detail around errors using various configuration variables to specify the verbosity and the log level.</description></item></channel></rss>
