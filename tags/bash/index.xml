With support for two launch types, EC2 and Fargate, ECS allows you to run containers on your cluster of EC2 instances or have AWS manage your underlying infrastructure with Fargate. The Fargate launch type provides a serverless-like experience for running containers, allowing you to focus on your applications instead of infrastructure.</description></item></channel></rss>
