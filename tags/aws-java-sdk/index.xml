With the AWS Java SDK, Java developers can build applications that work with various AWS services, like Simple Email Service (SES), Simple Queue Service (SQS), Simple Notification Service (SNS), and more. Simple Email Service (SES) is a cloud-based email-sending service that enables developers to integrate email functionality into their applications running on AWS. SES allows developers to work without an on-prem Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) system and send bulk emails to many recipients.</description></item><item><title>End-to-End Testing in Gitlab CI with Testcontainers and LocalStack: Understanding Runners and Docker in Docker</title><link>/tutorials/gitlab_ci_testcontainers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/gitlab_ci_testcontainers/</guid><description>Introduction: Testcontainers &amp;amp; LocalStack Testcontainers is an open-source framework that provides lightweight APIs for bootstrapping local development and test dependencies with real services wrapped in Docker containers. Running tests with Testcontainers and LocalStack is crucial for AWS-powered applications because it ensures each test runs in a clean, isolated environment, providing consistency across all development and CI machines. LocalStack avoids AWS costs by emulating services locally, preventing exceeding AWS free tier limits, and eliminates reliance on potentially unstable external AWS services.</description></item></channel></rss>
