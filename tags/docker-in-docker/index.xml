Running tests with Testcontainers and LocalStack is crucial for AWS-powered applications because it ensures each test runs in a clean, isolated environment, providing consistency across all development and CI machines. LocalStack avoids AWS costs by emulating services locally, preventing exceeding AWS free tier limits, and eliminates reliance on potentially unstable external AWS services.</description></item></channel></rss>
