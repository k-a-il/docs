These functions can be deployed as individual units within the AWS ecosystem. Lambda offers seamless integration with various AWS services and supports multiple programming languages for different runtime environments. To deploy Lambda functions programmatically, you have two options: uploading a ZIP file containing your code and dependencies or packaging your code in a container image and deploying it through Elastic Container Registry (ECR).</description></item></channel></rss>
