These functions can be deployed as individual units within the AWS ecosystem. Lambda offers seamless integration with various AWS services and supports multiple programming languages for different runtime environments. To deploy Lambda functions programmatically, you have two options: uploading a ZIP file containing your code and dependencies or packaging your code in a container image and deploying it through Elastic Container Registry (ECR).</description></item><item><title>Docker Images</title><link>/references/docker-images/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/references/docker-images/</guid><description>LocalStack functions as a local “mini-cloud” operating system that runs inside a Docker container. LocalStack has multiple components, which include process management, file system abstraction, event processing, schedulers, and more. Running inside a Docker container, LocalStack exposes external network ports for integrations, SDKs, or CLI interfaces to connect to LocalStack APIs. The LocalStack &amp;amp; LocalStack Pro Docker images have been downloaded over 130+ million times and provide a multi-arch build compatible with AMD/x86 and ARM-based CPU architectures.</description></item></channel></rss>
