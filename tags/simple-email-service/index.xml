With the AWS Java SDK, Java developers can build applications that work with various AWS services, like Simple Email Service (SES), Simple Queue Service (SQS), Simple Notification Service (SNS), and more. Simple Email Service (SES) is a cloud-based email-sending service that enables developers to integrate email functionality into their applications running on AWS. SES allows developers to work without an on-prem Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) system and send bulk emails to many recipients.</description></item></channel></rss>
