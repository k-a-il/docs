It is used to capture data generated by producers and distribute it among its consumers. Kafka is known for its scalability, with reports of production environments scaling to trillions of messages per day. With Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK), AWS provides a service to provision Apache Kafka clusters easily.
LocalStack Pro supports Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka (MSK), which enables you to spin up Kafka clusters on your local machine and test the integration of your applications with Amazon MSK.</description></item></channel></rss>
