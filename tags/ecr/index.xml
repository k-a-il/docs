These functions can be deployed as individual units within the AWS ecosystem. Lambda offers seamless integration with various AWS services and supports multiple programming languages for different runtime environments. To deploy Lambda functions programmatically, you have two options: uploading a ZIP file containing your code and dependencies or packaging your code in a container image and deploying it through Elastic Container Registry (ECR).</description></item><item><title>Deploying containers on Elastic Container Service (ECS) clusters using Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and AWS Fargate, with LocalStack</title><link>/tutorials/ecs-ecr-container-app/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/tutorials/ecs-ecr-container-app/</guid><description>Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is a fully-managed container orchestration service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of Docker containers on AWS. With support for two launch types, EC2 and Fargate, ECS allows you to run containers on your cluster of EC2 instances or have AWS manage your underlying infrastructure with Fargate. The Fargate launch type provides a serverless-like experience for running containers, allowing you to focus on your applications instead of infrastructure.</description></item></channel></rss>
