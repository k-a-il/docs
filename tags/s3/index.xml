It allows next-generation state management and team collaboration for your local cloud development environment, which you can utilize to create persistent shareable cloud sandboxes. Cloud Pods works directly with the LocalStack CLI to save, merge, and restore snapshots of your LocalStack state. You can always tear down your LocalStack instance and restore it from a snapshot at any point in time.</description></item></channel></rss>
