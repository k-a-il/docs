The environment configuration ENFORCE_IAM=1 is required while starting LocalStack to enable this feature. Per default, IAM enforcement is disabled, and all APIs can be accessed without authentication.
Getting started This guide is designed for users new to IAM Policy Enforcement and assumes basic knowledge of the AWS CLI and our awslocal wrapper script.</description></item><item><title>Explainable IAM</title><link>/user-guide/security-testing/explainable-iam/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/user-guide/security-testing/explainable-iam/</guid><description>Introduction The IAM Policy Engine logs output related to failed policy evaluation directly to the LocalStack logs. You can enable DEBUG=1 to gain visibility into these log messages, allowing you to identify the additional policies required for your request to succeed.

When a request is made, it initially displays the principal or resource to which the policy will be attached. This is typically a service resource for resource-based policies, or an IAM principal for other cases. Subsequently, it displays the suggested policy. This feature aids in identifying the correct permissions for cloud applications and can help spot logical errors, such as unexpected actions in a policy.</description></item></channel></rss>
